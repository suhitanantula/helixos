# Welcome to HelixOS

The canonical source of truth for The Helix Lab's frameworks, methodologies, and diagnostic tools.

HelixOS is a living system. Frameworks are versioned, validated against real client engagements, and continuously refined.

## Core Frameworks

| Framework | Question It Answers |
|-----------|---------------------|
| [9Q Framework](/frameworks/9q) | Where should our AI portfolio be positioned? |
| [AAA Maturity Model](/frameworks/aaa) | Are we ready? How do we progress? |
| [Lines, Loops & Vibes](/frameworks/llv) | What's the rhythm of our organization? |
| [The 4A Process](/frameworks/4a) | How does work change? |

## The Unified Logic

All Helix Lab frameworks share a common foundation: **AAA (Assist → Augment → Adapt)**. This core logic applies internally as capability maturity and externally as the 9Q strategic positioning grid. One language, two expressions.

## How to Use HelixOS

- **Clients**: Reference frameworks during engagements, track your assessment results
- **Readers**: Explore the intellectual foundation behind "The Co-Intelligent Organisation"
- **Agents**: Query the structured API endpoints at `/api/*.json` for programmatic framework access
