# Welcome to HelixOS

The canonical source of truth for The Helix Lab's frameworks, methodologies, and diagnostic tools.

HelixOS is a living system. Frameworks are versioned, validated against real client engagements, and continuously refined.

## Core Frameworks

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
  <FrameworkCard
    name="9Q Framework™"
    question="Where should our AI portfolio be positioned?"
    href="/frameworks/9q"
    tags={["strategy", "positioning"]}
  />
  <FrameworkCard
    name="AAA Maturity Model™"
    question="Are we ready? How do we progress?"
    href="/frameworks/aaa"
    tags={["maturity", "capability"]}
  />
  <FrameworkCard
    name="Lines, Loops & Vibes™"
    question="What's the rhythm of our organization?"
    href="/frameworks/llv"
    tags={["work-types", "rhythm"]}
  />
  <FrameworkCard
    name="The 4A Process™"
    question="How does work change with AI?"
    href="/frameworks/4a"
    tags={["transformation", "process"]}
  />
</div>

## The Unified Logic

All Helix Lab frameworks share a common foundation: **AAA (Assist → Augment → Adapt)**. This core logic applies internally as capability maturity and externally as the 9Q strategic positioning grid. One language, two expressions.

## How to Use HelixOS

- **Clients**: Reference frameworks during engagements, track your assessment results
- **Readers**: Explore the intellectual foundation behind "The Co-Intelligent Organisation"
- **Agents**: Query the structured API endpoints at `/api/*.json` for programmatic framework access
