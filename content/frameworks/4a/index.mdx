# The 4A Process™

**Before you transform work with AI, ask: should this work exist at all?**

The 4A Process guides how individual work activities transform in an AI-enabled organization.

## The Four Options

### 1. Abandon
**Stop doing it.** Some work exists because of legacy constraints, not value creation.

- Reports no one reads
- Approvals that add no judgment
- Processes that exist "because we always have"

**AI opportunity:** None. Just stop.

### 2. Assist
**AI helps, human does.** The work remains fundamentally human; AI provides support.

- Drafting with AI suggestions
- Research with AI search
- Communication with AI translation

**AI role:** Tool. Human initiates, AI responds.

### 3. Augment
**AI and human collaborate.** The work becomes a partnership between human judgment and AI capability.

- Co-authoring with AI
- Decision-making with AI analysis
- Design with AI generation

**AI role:** Collaborator. AI suggests, human decides.

### 4. Adapt
**AI acts, human oversees.** The work is delegated to AI within defined boundaries.

- Autonomous customer service
- Self-directing workflows
- Predictive maintenance

**AI role:** Agent. AI acts, human supervises.

## Why Abandon Comes First

The 4A Process deliberately puts Abandon first. Before investing in AI transformation:

1. **Audit existing work** — What adds value? What's legacy?
2. **Eliminate waste** — Stop doing work that shouldn't exist
3. **Then transform** — Apply Assist/Augment/Adapt to remaining work

Most organizations skip this step. They automate waste instead of eliminating it.

## Connection to Other Frameworks

- **4A to AAA:** Each tier unlocks different 4A options
- **4A to LLV:** Lines often → Assist/Adapt, Loops → Augment, Vibes → carefully consider
- **4A to 9Q:** Your portfolio of 4A choices shapes your 9Q position
