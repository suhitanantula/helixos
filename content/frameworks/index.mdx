# Frameworks

The Helix Lab frameworks form an interconnected system for understanding and navigating AI transformation.

## The Core Logic

All frameworks share a common foundation: **AAA (Assist → Augment → Adapt)**. This progression describes how human-AI relationships evolve — from AI as tool, to AI as collaborator, to AI as autonomous agent.

## Framework Overview

| Framework | Focus | Key Question |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| [9Q Framework](/frameworks/9q) | Strategic positioning | Where should our AI portfolio be positioned? |
| [AAA Maturity Model](/frameworks/aaa) | Capability readiness | Are we ready? How do we progress? |
| [Lines, Loops & Vibes](/frameworks/llv) | Organizational rhythm | What's the rhythm of our organization? |
| [The 4A Process](/frameworks/4a) | Work transformation | How does work change with AI? |

## How They Connect

```
       AAA (Internal Capability)
              ↓
    9Q (External Position)
              ↓
    LLV (Operating Rhythm)
              ↓
    4A (Work Transformation)
```

**AAA** defines your internal capability maturity. **9Q** maps that capability to strategic market positions. **LLV** reveals how your organization actually operates. **4A** guides how individual work transforms.

## Validation

These frameworks have been validated across 11 Australian enterprises spanning 7 industries, from financial services to mining to retail.
