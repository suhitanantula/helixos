# The Nine Quadrants

Each quadrant represents a distinct strategic position with specific characteristics, requirements, and examples.

## Assist Row (V1)

### Q1: Basic Assistant
**User-initiated, static responses**

- Customer asks, AI answers with fixed rules
- No learning, no personalization
- Low trust required, low value delivered

*Examples:* FAQ bots, basic search, rule-based chatbots

### Q2: Smart Assistant
**User-initiated, learning system**

- Customer asks, AI answers and improves
- Learns from interactions, personalizes responses
- Moderate trust required

*Examples:* Smart search, learning chatbots, recommendation previews

### Q3: Intelligent Assistant
**User-initiated, self-directing execution**

- Customer asks, AI handles complex execution
- Autonomous within the request scope
- Higher trust in execution capability

*Examples:* Research agents, code assistants, analysis tools

## Augment Row (V2)

### Q4: Co-Create
**AI suggests, human decides, fixed rules**

- AI proactively offers options
- Human retains all decision authority
- Static suggestion logic

*Examples:* Template generators, basic design tools, fixed recommendations

### Q5: Curator
**AI suggests, learns, human retains authority**

- AI proactively suggests with improving accuracy
- Human decides, AI learns from decisions
- Builds understanding over time

*Examples:* Content curation, smart feeds, adaptive recommendations

**Note:** Q5 is currently the "sweet spot" — where most leading organizations cluster.

### Q6: Partner
**AI suggests, self-directs within domain**

- AI makes autonomous decisions in defined areas
- Human sets boundaries, AI operates within them
- High capability, bounded authority

*Examples:* Autonomous trading (within limits), dynamic pricing, adaptive workflows

---

## Adapt Row (V3)

### Q7: Proxy
**AI acts on behalf, fixed rules**

- AI takes actions for the customer
- Operates under rigid, predefined rules
- Trust in rules, not in AI judgment

*Examples:* Auto-bill-pay, scheduled transactions, rule-based automation

**Note:** Q7 remains largely empty — customers resist static proxies. They want learning or full human control.

### Q8: Intelligent Proxy
**AI acts on behalf, learns and improves**

- AI takes actions and gets better at it
- Learns preferences, optimizes outcomes
- High trust relationship

*Examples:* Intelligent portfolio management, adaptive scheduling, learning automation

### Q9: Orchestrator
**AI acts, self-directs, optimizes autonomously**

- Full autonomous operation within domain
- Self-directing, self-optimizing
- Highest trust and capability requirements

*Examples:* Autonomous mining operations, self-driving logistics, fully automated trading
