# 9Q Framework Validation

The 9Q Framework has been validated through systematic analysis of AI initiatives across multiple sectors.

## Methodology

### Sample
- 11 major Australian enterprises
- 7 industries
- 50+ distinct AI initiatives analyzed

### Process
1. Identified all publicly visible AI initiatives
2. Classified each on both 9Q axes
3. Mapped to quadrant positions
4. Identified patterns and gaps

### Validation Criteria
- Independent classification by multiple analysts
- Cross-reference with public statements and filings
- Sector expert review

## Findings

### Quadrant Distribution

<QuadrantGrid highlighted={["Q3", "Q4", "Q5", "Q8"]} annotation="Validated positions across 11 Australian enterprises" clickable={false} />

| Quadrant | Companies | Count |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Q3 | Services Australia | 1 |
| Q4 | ANZ, Optus, Bunnings | 3 |
| Q5 | CBA, NAB, Westpac, Woolworths, Telstra | 5 |
| Q8 | Rio Tinto, Fortescue | 2 |

### Key Insights

**1. Q5 is the current sweet spot**
Five of eleven companies cluster in Q5 (Curator position). This represents the current equilibrium between capability and trust.

**2. Q1–Q2 are empty (table stakes)**
No company positions their primary AI initiatives here. Basic assistance is assumed, not differentiated.

**3. Q7 remains empty (trust barrier)**
Static proxies — AI acting on behalf with fixed rules — face customer resistance. People want either full control or intelligent adaptation.

**4. Mining leads on autonomy**
Rio Tinto and Fortescue achieve Q8 positions. Industrial contexts have lower customer trust barriers (B2B, remote operations).

**5. Government lags**
Services Australia at Q3 is the highest government position. Public trust, equity requirements, and regulatory constraints limit autonomous positioning.

## Sector Analysis

### Financial Services (CBA, NAB, Westpac, ANZ)

**Current state:** Q4–Q5 cluster
**Direction:** Q6 for advisory, Q8 for operations
**Insight:** Regulation simultaneously enables (risk management drives maturity) and constrains (limits autonomy)

*Notable:* CBA leads on maturity, driven by APRA requirements following 2018 royal commission.

### Retail (Woolworths, Bunnings)

**Current state:** Q4–Q5
**Direction:** Q6 personalization
**Insight:** Customer-facing AI remains advisory; supply chain moving to higher autonomy

### Telco (Telstra, Optus)

**Current state:** Q4–Q5
**Direction:** Q6 for customer service
**Insight:** Network operations already highly autonomous; customer-facing lagging

### Mining (Rio Tinto, Fortescue)

**Current state:** Q5–Q8
**Direction:** Q9 for autonomous operations
**Insight:** B2B context allows higher autonomy; safety focus drives automation

### Government (Services Australia)

**Current state:** Q3
**Direction:** Q5 target
**Insight:** Public accountability limits autonomous positioning; equity requirements constrain personalization

## Limitations

1. **Public data only** — Internal initiatives not captured
2. **Point in time** — Positions shift over time
3. **Classification judgment** — Some initiatives span quadrants
4. **Australian focus** — May not generalize globally

## Implications

### For Organizations
- Benchmark against sector peers
- Identify positioning whitespace
- Understand trust barriers in your context

### For the Framework
- Validation confirms grid structure
- Empty quadrants have structural explanations
- Diagonal progression pattern holds
