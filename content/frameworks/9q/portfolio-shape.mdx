# Portfolio Shape

Individual AI initiatives occupy single quadrants. But organizations don't have one initiative — they have portfolios. The *shape* of that portfolio tells a strategic story.

## Reading Portfolio Shapes

Plot all your AI initiatives on the grid. The resulting pattern reveals:

1. **Concentration** — Where is your center of gravity?
2. **Spread** — How diversified is your portfolio?
3. **Direction** — Where are you heading?
4. **Gaps** — What positions are you avoiding?

## Common Portfolio Patterns

### The Diagonal Line
```
      Q9
    Q5
  Q1
```
**Pattern:** Progressive maturity across initiatives
**Interpretation:** Balanced growth, building capability systematically
**Risk:** Slow, may be outpaced by competitors

### The Horizontal Spread
```
  Q4  Q5  Q6
```
**Pattern:** Same customer autonomy, varying execution
**Interpretation:** Experimenting with execution models
**Risk:** Not building toward higher customer trust

### The Vertical Stack
```
  Q7
  Q4
  Q1
```
**Pattern:** Same execution model, varying customer autonomy
**Interpretation:** Single technology platform, multiple applications
**Risk:** Execution capability may not match customer expectations

### The Cluster
```
    Q5 Q5
    Q4 Q5
```
**Pattern:** Tight concentration in one area
**Interpretation:** Deep expertise in one position
**Risk:** Vulnerable to disruption, limited growth

### The Barbell
```
Q9
        Q4
Q1
```
**Pattern:** Extremes without middle
**Interpretation:** Exploring boundaries
**Risk:** Missing foundational capability building

## Shape Strategy

### Intentional vs. Emergent
Most portfolio shapes are *emergent* — the result of uncoordinated decisions. High-performing organizations create *intentional* shapes aligned with strategy.

### Shape Questions
1. What shape do we have today?
2. What shape do we want in 3 years?
3. What initiatives move us from current to target?
4. What initiatives should we stop, start, or accelerate?

### Shape and Capability
Your portfolio shape must match your capability shape (AAA maturity). You can't sustain high-quadrant positions without corresponding internal capability.

## Portfolio Governance

Use the 9Q grid for AI portfolio governance:

| Review Question | What to Check |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Balance | Are we over-concentrated? |
| Direction | Are new initiatives moving us toward target? |
| Capability match | Does our AAA maturity support our positions? |
| Competitor comparison | How does our shape compare to competitors? |
