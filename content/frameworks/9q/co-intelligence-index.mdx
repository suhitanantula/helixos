# The CoIntelligence Index™

The CoIntelligence Index provides a single score representing an organization's overall position on the human-AI collaboration spectrum.

## The Score

**CoIntelligence Index = Weighted average of 9Q positions across the portfolio**

| Component | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Customer-facing positions | 50% | External value creation |
| Internal operations positions | 30% | Operational capability |
| Innovation/experimental positions | 20% | Future readiness |

## Calculating Your Index

### Step 1: Map Initiatives
Plot all AI initiatives on the 9Q grid.

### Step 2: Assign Scores
Each quadrant has a base score:

| Quadrant | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Q1 | 1 |
| Q2 | 2 |
| Q3 | 3 |
| Q4 | 4 |
| Q5 | 5 |
| Q6 | 6 |
| Q7 | 7 |
| Q8 | 8 |
| Q9 | 9 |

### Step 3: Weight by Significance
Weight each initiative by its strategic significance (revenue impact, customer reach, operational importance).

### Step 4: Calculate Index
Sum weighted scores ÷ Sum of weights = CoIntelligence Index

## Interpreting the Index

| Index Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| 1.0 – 2.5 | **Foundational** — Early AI adoption, basic assistance |
| 2.5 – 4.5 | **Developing** — Building AI collaboration capabilities |
| 4.5 – 6.5 | **Advancing** — Mature human-AI collaboration |
| 6.5 – 8.0 | **Leading** — Significant autonomous operations |
| 8.0 – 9.0 | **Transformative** — AI-native business model |

## Benchmark Data

Cross-sector Australian benchmarks (2025):

| Sector | Average Index | Range |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Banking | 4.8 | 4.2 – 5.4 |
| Retail | 4.1 | 3.5 – 4.8 |
| Mining | 5.2 | 4.0 – 6.8 |
| Government | 2.8 | 2.0 – 3.5 |
| Telco | 4.5 | 4.0 – 5.0 |

## Using the Index

### Strategic Planning
- Set target index for 1, 3, 5 year horizons
- Identify initiatives that move the index
- Balance quick wins vs. transformative moves

### Competitive Analysis
- Compare index to industry benchmarks
- Identify leaders and their strategies
- Find whitespace opportunities

### Board Reporting
- Single metric for AI progress
- Comparable across business units
- Trackable over time

## Index Limitations

The CoIntelligence Index is a summary metric. It doesn't capture:

- Portfolio shape (concentration vs. spread)
- Capability-position alignment
- Rate of change
- Qualitative factors

Use alongside full 9Q portfolio analysis, not as a replacement.
