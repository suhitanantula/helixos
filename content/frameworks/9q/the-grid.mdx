# The 9Q Grid

The 9Q Framework™ maps AI initiatives on a 3×3 grid defined by two axes of autonomy.

## The Two Axes

### Vertical Axis: Customer Autonomy

How much decision-making authority does the AI have in relation to the customer?

| Level | Name | Definition |
|-------|------|------------|
| V1 | **Assist** | AI helps, customer decides and acts |
| V2 | **Augment** | AI suggests, customer retains authority |
| V3 | **Adapt** | AI acts on customer's behalf within boundaries |

### Horizontal Axis: Execution Autonomy

How does the AI's execution capability evolve?

| Level | Name | Definition |
|-------|------|------------|
| H1 | **Static** | Fixed rules, no learning |
| H2 | **Adaptive** | Learns and improves over time |
| H3 | **Autonomous** | Self-directs within domain |

## The Full Grid

|  | Static (H1) | Adaptive (H2) | Autonomous (H3) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Adapt (V3)** | Q7 Proxy | Q8 Intelligent Proxy | Q9 Orchestrator |
| **Augment (V2)** | Q4 Co-Create | Q5 Curator | Q6 Partner |
| **Assist (V1)** | Q1 Basic | Q2 Smart | Q3 Intelligent |

## Reading the Grid

**Moving right** (H1 → H3): Increasing execution sophistication
- Static → Adaptive → Autonomous
- From fixed rules to self-directing systems

**Moving up** (V1 → V3): Increasing customer autonomy delegation
- Assist → Augment → Adapt
- From AI as tool to AI as agent

**The diagonal** (Q1 → Q5 → Q9): The natural progression path
- Most organizations move along this diagonal
- Each step requires both capability growth and trust growth

## Strategic Implications

### Position ≠ Value
Higher quadrants aren't inherently better. The right position depends on:
- Customer trust levels
- Regulatory constraints
- Organizational capability
- Competitive dynamics

### The Capability-Position Match
Your internal capability (AAA maturity) must match your external position (9Q quadrant). Misalignment is the #1 cause of AI initiative failure.
