# The 9Q Framework™

**The question isn't whether to invest in AI. It's where.**

The 9Q Framework is a strategic positioning tool that maps AI initiatives across two dimensions:

- **Vertical axis (Customer Autonomy):** Assist → Augment → Adapt
- **Horizontal axis (Execution Autonomy):** Static → Adaptive → Autonomous

This produces nine distinct strategic positions — from Q1 (Basic Assistant) to Q9 (Autonomous Orchestrator).

## The Grid

|  | Static | Adaptive | Autonomous |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Adapt** | Q7 Proxy | Q8 Int. Proxy | Q9 Orchestrator |
| **Augment** | Q4 Co-Create | Q5 Curator | Q6 Partner |
| **Assist** | Q1 Basic | Q2 Smart | Q3 Intell |

## Why 9Q?

Every organization makes AI investment decisions. Most make them without a positioning framework. The 9Q Framework provides:

1. **A common language** — "We're Q5, targeting Q8" is immediately actionable
2. **Portfolio visibility** — Multiple initiatives create a *shape* on the grid
3. **Strategic clarity** — Not every initiative should be Q9. The right position depends on trust capital, capability, and sector constraints.

## The Unified Logic

9Q is AAA applied externally. The vertical axis *is* Assist → Augment → Adapt, applied to customer autonomy rather than internal capability. This means:

- Your **internal capability** (AAA maturity) must match your **external position** (9Q quadrant)
- You can't offer Q7–Q9 customer autonomy without Adapt-level internal capability
- Capability-position misalignment is the #1 cause of AI initiative failure

## Validation

Cross-sector validation across 11 Australian companies, 7 industries:

| Quadrant | Companies |
|----------|-----------|
| Q3 | Services Australia |
| Q4 | ANZ, Optus, Bunnings |
| Q5 | CBA, NAB, Westpac, Woolworths, Telstra |
| Q8 | Rio Tinto, Fortescue |

Key findings: Q5 is the current "sweet spot." No one occupies Q1–Q2 (table stakes). Q7 remains empty (customer trust prevents static proxies).
