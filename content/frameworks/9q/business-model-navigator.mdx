# Helix Business Model Navigator™

The 9Q Framework isn't just for individual initiatives — it's a lens for business model transformation.

## Business Models on the Grid

Different business models naturally occupy different grid regions:

| Business Model | Natural Position | Why |
|----------------|------------------|-----|
| **Traditional Service** | Q1–Q3 | Human-delivered, AI assists |
| **Platform** | Q4–Q6 | AI augments human decisions |
| **Autonomous Service** | Q7–Q9 | AI acts on behalf of customers |

## The Business Model Shift

### From Service to Platform
Moving from Q1–Q3 to Q4–Q6:
- Customers gain more control
- AI becomes collaborative partner
- Value shifts from execution to curation

### From Platform to Autonomous
Moving from Q4–Q6 to Q7–Q9:
- AI takes delegated authority
- Customers trust AI to act
- Value shifts from recommendation to outcome

## Navigation Principles

### 1. Follow the Trust
Business model shifts require customer trust shifts. You can't force customers up the grid faster than their trust allows.

### 2. Build Capability First
Internal capability (AAA) must lead external position (9Q). Build Adapt-level capability before offering Adapt-level services.

### 3. Protect the Core
Don't abandon lower-quadrant offerings while building higher ones. Customers need migration paths.

### 4. Watch the Gaps
Q7 remains empty for a reason. Some positions may be structurally difficult regardless of capability.

## Industry Patterns

### Financial Services
- Current center: Q5 (Curator)
- Direction: Q6 (Partner) for wealth, Q8 for operations
- Barrier: Regulatory constraints on autonomy

### Retail
- Current center: Q4–Q5
- Direction: Q6 for personalization
- Opportunity: Q8 for supply chain

### Mining/Industrial
- Current center: Q5 operations
- Direction: Q8–Q9 for autonomous operations
- Advantage: Lower customer trust barriers (B2B)

### Government
- Current center: Q3
- Direction: Q5 for citizen services
- Barrier: Public trust, equity requirements

## The Navigator Process

1. **Map current state** — Plot all offerings on the grid
2. **Identify target state** — Where should each offering move?
3. **Gap analysis** — What capability and trust gaps exist?
4. **Sequence moves** — Which moves enable which others?
5. **Track progress** — Monitor position shifts over time
