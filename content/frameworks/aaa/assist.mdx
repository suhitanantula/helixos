# Assist Tier

**AI as a tool. Humans initiate, AI responds.**

The Assist tier represents the foundational level of human-AI collaboration. AI systems at this level wait for human instruction and respond within defined parameters.

## Characteristics

| Dimension | Assist Tier |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Initiative** | Human initiates all interactions |
| **Decision authority** | Human retains 100% |
| **AI role** | Reactive tool |
| **Trust required** | Low |
| **Organizational change** | Minimal |

## Typical Applications

### Productivity Tools
- Document drafting assistance
- Email composition helpers
- Meeting transcription and summarization
- Basic research and search

### Customer Service
- FAQ chatbots
- Guided troubleshooting
- Information lookup
- Ticket routing

### Operations
- Data entry automation
- Report generation
- Basic process automation
- Alert and notification systems

## Benefits

1. **Quick wins** — Fast to deploy, immediate value
2. **Low risk** — Human oversight on all decisions
3. **Skill building** — Teams learn to work with AI
4. **Foundation** — Builds infrastructure for higher tiers

## Limitations

1. **Bounded value** — Limited to task acceleration
2. **No learning** — Doesn't improve from interactions
3. **Human bottleneck** — Requires human for every decision
4. **Commoditizing** — Quickly becomes table stakes

## Organizational Requirements

### Technology
- Basic AI/ML infrastructure
- Integration with existing tools
- Standard security controls

### People
- Basic AI literacy
- Willingness to adopt new tools
- Change management fundamentals

### Process
- Defined use cases
- Basic governance
- Feedback mechanisms

## Transition to Augment

**Key question:** Is the AI learning from interactions and proactively suggesting?

**Signs you're ready:**
- Consistent usage patterns
- Users requesting "smarter" responses
- Data infrastructure maturing
- Trust building with AI outputs

**Maturity gates:**
- AI accuracy consistently above threshold
- User adoption above critical mass
- Data feedback loops established
- Governance framework in place
