# Adapt Tier

**AI as an agent. AI acts on behalf, humans oversee.**

The Adapt tier represents the highest level of human-AI collaboration. AI systems at this level operate autonomously within defined boundaries, with humans providing oversight rather than direct control.

## Characteristics

| Dimension | Adapt Tier |
|-----------|------------|
| **Initiative** | AI acts autonomously |
| **Decision authority** | Delegated to AI within boundaries |
| **AI role** | Autonomous agent |
| **Trust required** | High |
| **Organizational change** | Transformational |

## Typical Applications

### Autonomous Operations
- Self-driving logistics
- Autonomous manufacturing
- Automated trading (within limits)
- Self-healing systems

### Intelligent Agents
- Customer service agents (full resolution)
- Procurement agents
- Scheduling and resource agents
- Quality control systems

### Orchestration
- Multi-system coordination
- Dynamic resource optimization
- Real-time adaptation to conditions
- Continuous improvement loops

## Benefits

1. **Speed** — Decisions at machine pace
2. **Scale** — Handle volume humans cannot
3. **Consistency** — Uniform application of rules
4. **24/7** — Continuous operation without fatigue

## Challenges

1. **Governance complexity** — Clear boundaries essential
2. **Trust requirements** — Stakeholders must believe
3. **Failure modes** — New categories of risk
4. **Skill transformation** — Oversight, not execution

## Organizational Requirements

### Technology
- Robust autonomous systems
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Automatic failsafes
- Explainability capabilities

### People
- Oversight and exception handling skills
- Systems thinking
- Risk management expertise
- Comfort with AI authority

### Process
- Clear delegation frameworks
- Continuous monitoring
- Exception escalation
- Regular boundary review

## The Trust Threshold

Adapt tier requires a fundamental trust shift. Organizations must trust:
- The AI's judgment within boundaries
- The governance framework
- The monitoring systems
- The ability to intervene when needed

This trust must exist at multiple levels:
- Leadership trust in the system
- Employee trust in the AI
- Customer trust in AI-driven outcomes
- Regulatory trust in controls

## Where Adapt Works

Adapt tier is most achievable where:

| Factor | Favorable | Unfavorable |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Stakes** | Reversible decisions | Irreversible harm |
| **Context** | Structured, predictable | Ambiguous, novel |
| **Feedback** | Fast, measurable | Slow, subjective |
| **Regulation** | Permissive or absent | Restrictive |
| **Customer** | B2B or indirect | Direct consumer |

This is why mining (Rio Tinto, Fortescue) leads on Adapt — remote operations, B2B context, measurable outcomes.

## The Override

Even at Adapt tier, the human override remains essential. Every Adapt system must include:

1. **Human can override** at any moment
2. **Override is logged** for learning
3. **Patterns are analyzed** for improvement
4. **Boundaries are adjusted** based on experience

The presence of override doesn't diminish autonomy — it enables it. Trust requires the ability to intervene.
