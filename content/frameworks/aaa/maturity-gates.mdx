# Maturity Gates

Moving between AAA tiers isn't automatic. Each transition requires passing through maturity gates — specific conditions that must be met before the next tier becomes viable.

## Assist → Augment Gate

**Core question:** Can the AI learn and proactively contribute?

### Technical Gates

| Gate | Threshold | Measure |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Data infrastructure | Production-ready ML pipeline | Can train and deploy models |
| Feedback loops | Closed loop | User actions inform model updates |
| Integration depth | Workflow-embedded | AI in core processes, not bolt-on |
| Accuracy baseline | Above 90% on defined tasks | Consistent, measurable performance |

### Organizational Gates

| Gate | Threshold | Measure |
|------|-----------|---------|
| User adoption | Above 70% of target users | Consistent, active usage |
| AI literacy | Basic proficiency | Teams can evaluate AI outputs |
| Process readiness | Redesigned workflows | Human+AI work patterns defined |
| Governance | Framework in place | Clear policies, escalation paths |

### Trust Gates

| Gate | Threshold | Measure |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Leadership buy-in | Executive sponsor | Active championship |
| User confidence | Positive sentiment | Users see value, not threat |
| Customer acceptance | Neutral or positive | No significant pushback |

## Augment → Adapt Gate

**Core question:** Can we delegate decision-making authority to the AI?

### Technical Gates

| Gate | Threshold | Measure |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Recommendation accuracy | Above 95% accepted | AI suggestions consistently good |
| Edge case handling | Defined coverage | Known limitations documented |
| Explainability | On-demand reasoning | Can explain any decision |
| Failsafe systems | Automatic triggers | System can halt and escalate |
| Audit capability | Complete traceability | Every action logged, reviewable |

### Organizational Gates

| Gate | Threshold | Measure |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Governance maturity | Delegation framework | Clear boundaries, authorities |
| Override patterns | Under 10% override rate | AI decisions rarely overridden |
| Incident response | Tested playbooks | Can handle AI failures |
| Skill transformation | Oversight capability | Teams can supervise, not just use |

### Trust Gates

| Gate | Threshold | Measure |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Leadership commitment | Board-level endorsement | Formal approval of autonomy |
| Regulatory comfort | Compliant design | Legal/compliance sign-off |
| Customer trust | Active consent | Customers accept AI agency |
| Public trust | Social license | External stakeholders comfortable |

## Gate Assessment Process

### Map Current State
For each gate, assess current status:
- Met
- Partial
- Not met

### Identify Blockers
Which unmet gates are blocking transition?
Which are easiest to address?

### Create Gate Plan
For each blocker:
- What actions close the gap?
- What resources required?
- What timeline realistic?

### Track Progress
Regular gate reviews:
- Monthly for active transitions
- Quarterly for future planning

## Common Gate Failures

### Premature Transition
Pushing to higher tier before gates are met:
- Technical failures
- User rejection
- Governance incidents
- Trust erosion

### Gate Washing
Declaring gates "met" without genuine readiness:
- Superficial compliance
- Hidden risks
- Delayed failures

### Gate Paralysis
Over-indexing on gates, never transitioning:
- Competitive disadvantage
- Talent frustration
- Opportunity cost

## Gate Principles

- **Gates are enablers, not barriers** — They ensure success, not prevent progress
- **Sequence matters** — Some gates must precede others
- **Gates can re-open** — Conditions change, reassess periodically
- **Context varies** — Gate thresholds depend on domain and risk
