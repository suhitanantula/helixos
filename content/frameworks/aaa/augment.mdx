# Augment Tier

**AI as a collaborator. AI suggests, humans decide.**

The Augment tier represents a shift from reactive tools to proactive partnership. AI systems at this level anticipate needs, make recommendations, and learn from human decisions.

## Characteristics

| Dimension | Augment Tier |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Initiative** | AI proactively suggests |
| **Decision authority** | Human retains authority |
| **AI role** | Collaborative partner |
| **Trust required** | Moderate |
| **Organizational change** | Significant |

## Typical Applications

### Decision Support
- Recommendation engines
- Predictive analytics dashboards
- Risk assessment tools
- Scenario modeling

### Creative Collaboration
- Co-writing and editing
- Design generation and iteration
- Code pair programming
- Content curation

### Workflow Optimization
- Process recommendations
- Resource allocation suggestions
- Priority optimization
- Performance coaching

## Benefits

1. **Force multiplier** — Humans do more with AI partnership
2. **Quality improvement** — AI catches what humans miss
3. **Learning system** — Improves from every interaction
4. **Competitive advantage** — Differentiated capability

## Challenges

1. **Process redesign** — Existing workflows must change
2. **Skill development** — New competencies required
3. **Trust calibration** — When to follow vs. override AI
4. **Cultural shift** — From individual to human+AI work

## Organizational Requirements

### Technology
- ML platforms with feedback loops
- Real-time data infrastructure
- Advanced integration capabilities
- Robust monitoring and observability

### People
- AI collaboration skills
- Critical evaluation of AI outputs
- Comfort with ambiguity
- Growth mindset

### Process
- Redesigned workflows for human+AI
- Clear escalation paths
- Continuous improvement loops
- Outcome-based metrics

## The Augment Sweet Spot

Most organizations find their current sweet spot in the Augment tier. This is where:
- AI adds clear value
- Humans retain meaningful control
- Trust is sufficient but not stretched
- ROI is demonstrable

The Q5 cluster on the 9Q grid corresponds to mature Augment capability.

## Transition to Adapt

**Key question:** Are there decisions AI could make autonomously with human oversight?

**Signs you're ready:**
- High confidence in AI recommendations
- Users routinely accepting suggestions
- Governance mature enough for delegation
- Business case for autonomous operation

**Maturity gates:**
- AI recommendation acceptance rate above threshold
- Override patterns understood and acceptable
- Governance framework for delegated decisions
- Rollback and audit capabilities in place
