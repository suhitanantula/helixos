# AAA Maturity Model™

**Every organization is on a journey. AAA tells you where you are.**

The AAA Maturity Model describes how organizations progress through three distinct capability tiers in their AI transformation:

## The Three Tiers

### Assist
AI as a **tool**. Humans initiate, AI responds. The human remains fully in control.

- Chatbots, search assistants, basic automation
- Low trust required
- Quick wins, minimal organizational change

### Augment
AI as a **collaborator**. AI suggests, humans decide. The human retains authority but AI actively contributes.

- Co-pilots, recommendation engines, intelligent workflows
- Medium trust required
- Requires process redesign, new skills

### Adapt
AI as an **agent**. AI acts on behalf of humans within defined boundaries. The AI has delegated authority.

- Autonomous systems, self-directing AI, orchestration
- High trust required
- Requires governance, oversight frameworks, cultural shift

## Why Maturity Matters

You can't skip tiers. Each tier builds:

| Tier | Builds | Unlocks |
|------|--------|---------|
| Assist | Technical foundation, basic trust | Operational efficiency |
| Augment | Process integration, cultural readiness | Competitive advantage |
| Adapt | Governance frameworks, deep trust | Transformation |

## Connection to 9Q

AAA is the **vertical axis** of the 9Q Framework. Your internal AAA maturity determines which 9Q positions you can credibly occupy:

- Assist-level capability → Q1–Q3 positions only
- Augment-level capability → Q4–Q6 positions unlocked
- Adapt-level capability → Q7–Q9 positions possible
