# Helix Capability Navigator™

The Capability Navigator is a diagnostic tool for assessing organizational readiness across the AAA tiers.

## The Six Capability Dimensions

AI maturity isn't one-dimensional. Organizations must build capability across six interconnected dimensions:

### 1. Technology
**Infrastructure and systems capability**

| Assist | Augment | Adapt |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Basic AI tools | ML platforms | Autonomous systems |
| Point integrations | Workflow embedding | System orchestration |
| Manual deployment | MLOps pipeline | Self-improving systems |

### 2. Data
**Information assets and architecture**

| Assist | Augment | Adapt |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Accessible data | Curated datasets | Real-time data fabric |
| Basic quality | Active data management | Self-healing data |
| Siloed sources | Integrated views | Unified data platform |

### 3. People
**Skills and organizational design**

| Assist | Augment | Adapt |
|--------|---------|-------|
| AI users | AI collaborators | AI supervisors |
| Basic literacy | Evaluation skills | Oversight expertise |
| Individual adoption | Team redesign | Organizational transformation |

### 4. Process
**Ways of working**

| Assist | Augment | Adapt |
|--------|---------|-------|
| AI-assisted tasks | Human+AI workflows | AI-led processes |
| Manual oversight | Selective review | Exception-based intervention |
| Fixed procedures | Adaptive processes | Autonomous optimization |

### 5. Governance
**Control and accountability**

| Assist | Augment | Adapt |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Basic policies | Comprehensive framework | Delegation architecture |
| Manual compliance | Automated monitoring | Self-governing systems |
| Incident response | Proactive risk management | Autonomous risk handling |

### 6. Culture
**Mindset and ways of being**

| Assist | Augment | Adapt |
|--------|---------|-------|
| AI acceptance | AI partnership mindset | AI-native thinking |
| Tool orientation | Collaboration orientation | Orchestration orientation |
| Change tolerance | Change embrace | Continuous adaptation |

## Assessment Approach

### Scoring Each Dimension

For each dimension, rate current capability:

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Pre-Assist | Not started |
| 2 | Early Assist | Basic capability |
| 3 | Mature Assist | Full Assist capability |
| 4 | Early Augment | Transitioning to Augment |
| 5 | Mature Augment | Full Augment capability |
| 6 | Early Adapt | Transitioning to Adapt |
| 7 | Mature Adapt | Full Adapt capability |

### Capability Profile

Plot scores to create a capability profile:

```
Technology:  ████████░░ 6
Data:        ██████░░░░ 5
People:      ████░░░░░░ 4
Process:     █████░░░░░ 5
Governance:  ██████░░░░ 5
Culture:     ████░░░░░░ 4
```

### Profile Analysis

**Balanced profile:** All dimensions within 1-2 points
- Ready for next tier transition
- Sustainable advancement

**Unbalanced profile:** Dimensions vary by 3+ points
- Leading dimensions pull, lagging hold back
- Address gaps before tier transition

**Limiting factor:** Lowest dimension determines viable tier
- Overall tier = minimum dimension score
- Can't sustain higher tier with weak dimension

## Development Priorities

### Technology-led (most common)
Technology advances first, other dimensions follow.
Risk: Technical capability without organizational readiness.

### People-led
People capability drives other dimensions.
Benefit: Sustainable, adopted. Risk: Slow.

### Process-led
Process redesign forces other dimensions to follow.
Benefit: Clear change path. Risk: Resistance.

### Governance-led (regulated industries)
Governance framework enables other dimensions.
Benefit: Risk managed. Risk: Bureaucratic.

## Navigator Workshop

Run a Capability Navigator workshop:

1. **Assess** — Each stakeholder scores independently
2. **Compare** — Surface different perspectives
3. **Discuss** — Understand divergence
4. **Align** — Agree on current state
5. **Prioritize** — Identify development focus
6. **Plan** — Create capability roadmap
