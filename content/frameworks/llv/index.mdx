# Lines, Loops & Vibes™

**Every organization has a rhythm. LLV reveals it.**

Lines, Loops & Vibes is a diagnostic framework that categorizes organizational work into three distinct types, each with different characteristics for AI transformation.

## The Three Types

### Lines
**Repeatable, predictable work.** Clear inputs, clear outputs, consistent process.

- Invoice processing, data entry, standard reports
- High automation potential
- AI can own entirely (with oversight)

### Loops
**Learning cycles.** Work that improves through iteration, feedback, and refinement.

- Product development, continuous improvement, skill building
- Augmentation sweet spot
- AI accelerates learning, humans direct

### Vibes
**Intuition, culture, foresight.** Work that defies process — pattern recognition, relationship building, creative leaps.

- Strategy, innovation, leadership
- Low automation potential
- AI informs, humans decide

## Why It Matters

Most AI failures come from mismatched expectations:

| Work Type | Wrong Approach | Right Approach |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Lines | "Let's augment it" | Automate fully, free humans |
| Loops | "Let's automate it" | Augment the cycle, accelerate learning |
| Vibes | "AI can do this" | Inform with data, preserve human judgment |

## The Rhythm Signature

Every organization has a unique mix of Lines, Loops, and Vibes. This "rhythm signature" predicts:

- Where AI investment will pay off fastest
- What cultural resistance to expect
- How transformation should be sequenced
