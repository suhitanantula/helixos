# Loops

**Learning cycles. Work that improves through iteration, feedback, and refinement.**

Loops represent work that gets better over time. Each iteration generates learning that feeds back into the next cycle.

## Characteristics of Loops

| Dimension | Loops Work |
|-----------|------------|
| **Predictability** | Moderate — patterns emerge over time |
| **Variation** | High — each iteration different |
| **Expertise** | Evolving — continuously building |
| **Judgment** | Significant — context matters |
| **Learning** | Active — explicit improvement cycles |

## Examples of Loops

### Creative
- Product development
- Content creation
- Design iteration
- Campaign optimization
- User experience refinement

### Strategic
- Market analysis
- Competitive response
- Business model evolution
- Customer insight development
- Strategy refinement

### Operational
- Process improvement
- Quality optimization
- Talent development
- Supplier relationships
- Customer success management

### Technical
- Software development
- Model training
- A/B testing
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening

## AI Potential for Loops

**Augmentation sweet spot.** AI accelerates Loops but doesn't replace human judgment.

| Opportunity | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Faster iteration | AI handles grunt work in each cycle |
| Better data | AI surfaces patterns humans miss |
| More experiments | AI enables parallel exploration |
| Preserved learning | AI captures and applies learnings |
| Accelerated expertise | AI compresses the learning curve |

## The Loop Structure

Every Loop has four components:

```
     Act
      ↓
   Observe
      ↓
   Reflect
      ↓
   Decide
      ↓
   (back to Act)
```

### Act
Take action based on current understanding.
*AI role:* Execute components, track actions

### Observe
Gather data on results.
*AI role:* Collect data, measure outcomes, surface patterns

### Reflect
Interpret what happened and why.
*AI role:* Provide analysis, suggest interpretations

### Decide
Determine next action.
*AI role:* Present options, model scenarios — human decides

## Loops and the 4A Process

Loops work typically calls for **Augment**:

- AI accelerates each phase of the loop
- Human directs the learning, sets priorities
- Neither pure automation nor manual work

Some mature Loops can evolve to **Adapt** — AI-led with human oversight. But this requires:
- Deep understanding of the domain
- Clear success metrics
- Robust feedback mechanisms
- Tolerance for AI-directed experiments

## Identifying Loops Work

### Questions to Ask

1. Does this work improve with experience?
2. Is there a feedback mechanism?
3. Does variation reveal insights, not errors?
4. Does expertise matter beyond rule-following?
5. Would you describe this work as "practice"?

### Loop Health Check

For existing Loops:
1. Is the feedback loop closed?
2. How fast is each cycle?
3. Is learning being captured?
4. Are insights being applied?
5. Is the Loop accelerating or stagnating?

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Treating Loops as Lines
Forcing Loops into rigid processes, eliminating learning.

### Mistake 2: Automating the Human Out
Removing human judgment from Loops, destroying the learning engine.

### Mistake 3: Slow Loops
Allowing cycles to stretch too long, reducing learning rate.

### Mistake 4: Orphaned Loops
Loops without clear ownership, feedback ignored.

### Mistake 5: Undocumented Learning
Loops where learning stays tacit, not captured.

## AI-Accelerated Loops

The best AI applications for Loops:

| Application | How It Helps |
|-------------|--------------|
| Rapid prototyping | Faster Act phase |
| Real-time analytics | Faster Observe phase |
| Pattern recognition | Richer Reflect phase |
| Scenario modeling | Better Decide phase |
| Learning capture | Preserved across cycles |

→ [Lines](/frameworks/llv/lines) — work that repeats
→ [Vibes](/frameworks/llv/vibes) — work that intuits
