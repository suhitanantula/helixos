# Rhythm Signatures

Every organization has a unique mix of Lines, Loops, and Vibes work. This "rhythm signature" reveals how the organization actually operates — and predicts where AI will create value.

## Reading a Rhythm Signature

A rhythm signature is the percentage distribution of work across the three categories:

```
Lines: 40% | Loops: 35% | Vibes: 25%
```

This signature tells you:
- Where time and energy go
- What the organization values (implicitly)
- Where AI investment will pay off

## Common Signature Patterns

### The Factory (70-20-10)
**Lines dominant**

```
Lines: 70% | Loops: 20% | Vibes: 10%
```

**Characteristics:**
- High process standardization
- Efficiency-focused culture
- Clear hierarchies
- Predictable operations

**AI opportunity:** Massive automation potential in Lines. Risk of over-investing in automation without human redeployment.

**Examples:** Manufacturing, logistics, transaction processing

### The Studio (20-50-30)
**Loops dominant**

```
Lines: 20% | Loops: 50% | Vibes: 30%
```

**Characteristics:**
- Learning-oriented culture
- Iteration is normal
- Experimentation valued
- Outcomes over process

**AI opportunity:** Accelerate learning cycles. AI as creative partner.

**Examples:** Product companies, agencies, R&D organizations

### The Firm (30-30-40)
**Vibes dominant**

```
Lines: 30% | Loops: 30% | Vibes: 40%
```

**Characteristics:**
- Relationship-driven
- Judgment highly valued
- Senior expertise premium
- Client/stakeholder focus

**AI opportunity:** Inform decisions, don't automate them. Free up time for more Vibes work.

**Examples:** Professional services, advisory, executive leadership

### The Balanced (35-35-30)
**Even distribution**

```
Lines: 35% | Loops: 35% | Vibes: 30%
```

**Characteristics:**
- Diverse work types
- Multiple operating modes
- Adaptable culture
- Complex coordination

**AI opportunity:** Targeted interventions across all three. Requires nuanced strategy.

**Examples:** Large enterprises, diversified organizations

## Mapping Your Signature

### Step One: Identify Work Activities
List all recurring work activities for a role, team, or function.

### Step Two: Classify Each Activity
For each activity, determine: Lines, Loops, or Vibes?

Use these questions:
- Lines: Is it repeatable with clear rules?
- Loops: Does it improve through iteration?
- Vibes: Does it require intuition or relationships?

### Step Three: Estimate Time Allocation
What percentage of time goes to each category?

### Step Four: Validate
Check with people doing the work. Their perception matters.

### Step Five: Analyze
Compare actual signature to:
- Stated strategy
- Where value is created
- Where AI is being invested

## Signature Misalignments

### Strategy-Signature Gap
Organization says it values innovation (Loops) but signature shows 70% Lines.

**Implication:** Culture doesn't match aspirations. AI investment in Loops will face resistance.

### Value-Signature Gap
Value is created in Vibes work but signature shows minimal time there.

**Implication:** People are trapped in low-value work. Automate Lines to free time for Vibes.

### Investment-Signature Gap
AI investment targets Loops but signature shows the work is actually Vibes.

**Implication:** Wrong AI approach. Will automate the wrong things.

## Signature Evolution

Signatures aren't static. They shift as:
- AI automates Lines work
- Markets demand more Loops
- Relationships become more important

**Healthy evolution:** Lines percentage decreases as automation succeeds. Loops and Vibes percentages increase as humans focus on higher-value work.

**Unhealthy evolution:** Lines percentage stays high despite automation (make-work). Vibes percentage decreases (losing soul).

## Using Signatures for AI Strategy

### High Lines Signature
- Prioritize automation
- Plan for workforce transition
- Measure efficiency gains

### High Loops Signature
- Prioritize augmentation
- Accelerate learning cycles
- Measure iteration speed

### High Vibes Signature
- Prioritize information support
- Protect human judgment
- Measure decision quality
