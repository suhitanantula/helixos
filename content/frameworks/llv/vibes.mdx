# Vibes

**Intuition, culture, foresight. Work that defies process.**

Vibes represent the uniquely human work that resists systematization. This is pattern recognition at scale, relationship navigation, creative leaps, and the subtle judgments that shape organizational direction.

## Characteristics of Vibes

| Dimension | Vibes Work |
|-----------|------------|
| **Predictability** | Low — inherently uncertain |
| **Variation** | High — each situation unique |
| **Expertise** | Tacit — hard to articulate |
| **Judgment** | Central — the whole point |
| **Learning** | Subtle — wisdom, not knowledge |

## Examples of Vibes

### Leadership
- Organizational direction
- Culture shaping
- Stakeholder navigation
- Crisis response
- Talent judgment

### Strategy
- Opportunity sensing
- Timing decisions
- Competitive intuition
- Innovation direction
- Portfolio shaping

### Relationships
- Trust building
- Negotiation
- Conflict resolution
- Political navigation
- Partnership development

### Creative
- Vision articulation
- Brand essence
- Breakthrough innovation
- Artistic direction
- Narrative crafting

## AI Potential for Vibes

**Inform, don't replace.** AI can support Vibes work but cannot own it.

| Opportunity | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Data richness | AI brings more information to judgment |
| Pattern surface | AI highlights signals in noise |
| Scenario exploration | AI models possibilities |
| Bias awareness | AI surfaces blind spots |
| Documentation | AI captures Vibes decisions for learning |

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| No true intuition | AI pattern-matches, doesn't sense |
| No relationships | AI doesn't build trust |
| No accountability | AI can't own consequences |
| No meaning | AI doesn't understand significance |
| No wisdom | AI has information, not judgment |

## The Vibes Paradox

Vibes work is:
- **Hardest to measure** — but most valuable
- **Hardest to automate** — but most tempting to try
- **Hardest to develop** — but most important to cultivate

Organizations that try to systematize Vibes often destroy what made them valuable.

## Vibes and the 4A Process

Vibes work typically stays with humans:

- **Abandon**: Rarely — Vibes work usually matters
- **Assist**: AI provides information for human judgment
- **Augment**: Careful — AI suggests but doesn't diminish human centrality
- **Adapt**: Almost never — Vibes require human agency

## Protecting Vibes Work

### Give It Space
Vibes work needs time that's not measured by productivity metrics.

### Develop It
Vibes capabilities grow through experience, mentorship, and reflection.

### Value It
Recognize that ROI on Vibes work is real but not always quantifiable.

### Don't Automate It
Resist pressure to apply AI to everything. Some work should stay human.

## AI Supporting Vibes

When AI supports Vibes work:

### Do
- Provide richer context
- Surface relevant history
- Identify patterns across data
- Model scenarios
- Document decisions

### Don't
- Replace judgment calls
- Override human intuition
- Systematize relationship building
- Automate culture work
- Quantify the unquantifiable

## The Vibes Test

When considering AI for any work, ask:

1. **If AI did this, would it still have meaning?**
2. **Does this require reading the room?**
3. **Is trust a key ingredient?**
4. **Would systematization destroy value?**
5. **Does this require wisdom, not just knowledge?**

If yes to any — protect the Vibes.

## Vibes and Organizational Health

Organizations need all three:
- **Lines** for efficiency
- **Loops** for learning
- **Vibes** for wisdom

Unhealthy organizations often:
- Over-invest in Lines (efficiency theater)
- Under-invest in Loops (no learning)
- Eliminate Vibes (no soul)

The healthiest organizations protect Vibes work while automating Lines and accelerating Loops.

→ [Lines](/frameworks/llv/lines) — work that repeats
→ [Loops](/frameworks/llv/loops) — work that learns
