# Lines

**Repeatable structures. Clear inputs, clear outputs, consistent process.**

Lines represent the predictable, structured work that organizations do over and over. This is work that follows defined patterns and produces consistent results.

## Characteristics of Lines

| Dimension | Lines Work |
|-----------|------------|
| **Predictability** | High — same inputs, same outputs |
| **Variation** | Low — exceptions are rare |
| **Expertise** | Codifiable — can be written as rules |
| **Judgment** | Minimal — clear right/wrong answers |
| **Learning** | Stable — process doesn't evolve much |

## Examples of Lines

### Administrative
- Invoice processing
- Expense approvals (within policy)
- Data entry and validation
- Report generation
- Document formatting

### Operational
- Order fulfillment
- Inventory updates
- Compliance checking
- Quality verification
- Scheduling within rules

### Customer-facing
- FAQ responses
- Status updates
- Appointment booking
- Basic troubleshooting
- Information lookup

## AI Potential for Lines

**Automation sweet spot.** Lines work is where AI can take over entirely (with oversight).

| Opportunity | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Full automation | AI handles end-to-end |
| Speed | Machine pace, not human pace |
| Scale | Handle volume humans cannot |
| Consistency | Eliminate human error |
| Cost | Significant labor savings |

## The Lines Paradox

Lines work is essential but not differentiating. Organizations often:

1. **Over-invest in Lines** — Automating what doesn't matter
2. **Under-invest in freeing humans** — Automation without redeployment
3. **Miss the point** — Lines automation is foundation, not strategy

The strategic value of automating Lines is freeing humans for Loops and Vibes work.

## Lines and the 4A Process

Lines work often calls for **Abandon** or **Adapt**:

- **Abandon**: Stop doing Lines work that adds no value
- **Adapt**: Fully automate essential Lines work

Rarely should Lines work remain in Assist or Augment — that's inefficient middle ground.

## Identifying Lines Work

### Questions to Ask

1. Does this task follow documented procedures?
2. Could a new hire do this after training?
3. Are the inputs and outputs clearly defined?
4. Is variation an exception, not the norm?
5. Does judgment mean "follow the rules correctly"?

### Mapping Exercise

For a role or function:
1. List all recurring tasks
2. Classify each as Lines, Loops, or Vibes
3. Calculate time allocation across categories
4. Identify Lines work to automate or abandon

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Automating Bad Lines
Automating inefficient or unnecessary processes. First, ask: should this exist at all?

### Mistake 2: Partial Automation
Automating part of Lines work, leaving awkward human-machine handoffs.

### Mistake 3: No Human Redeployment
Automating Lines but not redeploying humans to higher-value work.

### Mistake 4: Treating Loops as Lines
Forcing learning cycles into rigid Lines structures, destroying value.

→ [Loops](/frameworks/llv/loops) — work that learns
→ [Vibes](/frameworks/llv/vibes) — work that intuits
